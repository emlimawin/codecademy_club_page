# Codecademy off-platform Project: Club Website

In this project I created a simple Webpage for a fictive Club of Cactus Enthusiast to share their knowledge and get in contact with each other.
Based on the instructions of Codecademy, the page is build in HTML and CSS only.
It provides basic responsiveness, but it does not include all media-queries, as it was not required to build a publish-ready website.

It also includes:
* flexbox
* css grid
* basic css-transitions
